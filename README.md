# My Playlist by Trevor Lomba

A single-page application with user authentication that interacts with a custom API served by Express. Registered users can create, read, update, and delete songs as part of a database of playlists, which is mapped to rows of a table and displayed on the DOM.

With this tool you are able to create a 'playlist' with multiple songs with information for each including title, artist, album, and isrc #. Users are only able to access the songs that they input into the system themselves using a personal login.

Future plans include building this out into a sample/music recommendation engine using Spotify's API.
